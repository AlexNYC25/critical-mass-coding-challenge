## Work/Project Examples
### What To Watch
A project I built on my own from the ground up, built to be a full stack web applications, with the front end application side of things being built on top of React.js with the standard Material UI library, and the front end application was created with the help of Next.js that provided the backend functionality.

### Cinematic Universe Guide
An API application I built on top of Node.js and Express.js to creates an API returing movie details from The Movie Database API with a focus on those that belong to a cinematic universe like the Marvel Cinematic Universe Guide and more, the API return details like the movie poster, synopsis and what movies or media are recomended to watch before you watch the movie in question, with the actual data being stored on a PostgreSQL database.

### Neetcode
An open source library of algorithm and data structure code project, originally created by the origianl creator in Java and Python, the project then became open source so others can jump in an being translating existing code into javascript as well ad adding missing code from already exisiting pseudocode, project tasks would be discussed on discord, where tasks would be broken down between volunteers.

## Insperation
## Neetcode.io
A website that compiled the resources and tools from the Neetcode project, I have always been a fan of the origianl project creator, he details alot of his progress on youtube in a way that makes it easier to understand from a developer's perspective, a lot of what we talked about in his videos I apply to my code when I work on my own projects.

## Focus
I think that I would really enjoy building something related to ecommerce, like building out a store front page. I feel like these kinds of projects are the perfect mix of making sure you have a visually appealing web page while still making the site functional like making sure the site has the necessary capabilities such as a working shopping cart, and making sure payments and orders can be handled properly.
